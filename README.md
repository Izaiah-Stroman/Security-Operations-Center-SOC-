## Security Operations Center (SOC)

This repository showcases a collection of projects centered around the setup, management, and operation of a Security Operations Center (SOC). These projects demonstrate key aspects of SOC activities, from threat hunting and vulnerability scanning to designing a defensible security architecture and performing in-depth network traffic analysis.

### Key Projects:
-- Security Assement & Vulnerability Scan 2 parts 
- **Performing a Security Assessment (Part 1)**: This project involves conducting a comprehensive security assessment, including network scans, vulnerability scans using tools like OpenVAS, and packet capture analysis with Wireshark. It emphasizes the importance of identifying and mitigating potential threats within a corporate network environment.

### Tools and Technologies:
- **Wireshark**: For deep packet inspection and network traffic analysis.
- **NMAP**: Used for network discovery and security auditing.
- **OpenVAS**: A full-featured vulnerability scanner to identify potential weaknesses in the network.
- **CrowdStrike Falcon**: For endpoint detection and response (EDR) and Zero Trust security architecture.
- **Security Onion**: An open-source platform for threat hunting, security monitoring, and log management.

### Significance:
The projects in this repository underscore the critical role of a SOC in safeguarding an organization's digital assets. From the identification and mitigation of threats to the development of a defensible security architecture, these projects reflect a deep understanding of the complexities involved in modern cybersecurity operations.
